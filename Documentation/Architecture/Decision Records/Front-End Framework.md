## Summary

### Issue

I want to pick out a front-end framework for the project. The language used will be JS.

### Decision

WIP

### Status

DRAFT

## Details

### Assumptions

1. I want to use a framework that is new to me to improve my learning.

### Constraints

1. The framework should be based on JS.
2. The framework should allow transformation to a Progressive Web App.

### Positions

Since I am starting on a new project, I would need a UI framework to facilitate development of UI screens. I already
have experience with both Angular and React, so, I would like to use something else, to get a chance to learn something
new. Also, since I am looking to port the webapp to a mobile app in the future, so, I want to explore frameworks which
allow me to do the same.

I started with exploring 3 frameworks - **Svelte**, **Vue** and **SolidJS**.

### Arguments

1.
