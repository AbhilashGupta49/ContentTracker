## Summary

### Issue

I want to pick out a front-end framework for the project. The language used will be JS.

### Decision

Use **Angular** as the front-end development framework.

### Status

ADOPTED

## Details

### Assumptions

1. I want to use a framework that I am familiar with to regain front-end development knowledge.

### Constraints

1. The framework should be based on JS.
2. The framework should allow transformation to a Progressive Web App.

### Positions

As I am starting on a new project, I would need a UI framework to facilitate development of UI screens.
Also, I am looking to port the webapp to a mobile app in the future, so, I want to explore frameworks which allows me to do the same.

I started with revisiting 2 frameworks - **React** and **Angular**.

React is the framework I am most familiar with as I was using it for a project relatively recently (`v16`). The latest version available as of now is `v18`.
React's website suggests that one of Next.js, Remix or Gatsby should be used for production-grade React deployment.

Angular is a framework that I have not used in a long time (last used version was `v7`). The latest version available as of now is `v16`.

### Arguments

1. Angular is the framework that I am going to be using soon for a work project, so I prefer to use Angular in this project to learn basics.
2. According to React's website - Next.js, Remix or Gatsby should be used for production usage of React, which implies that the back-end has to be written in JS too,
which I am not very keen to use for back-end development at this moment.
3. For this project's use case, I would be using Angular because of nothing other than personal preference.

### Implications
There would be a steep learning curve as I have not used Angular since a very long time. I have to be cognizant of the fact that switching to React will
not really be possible once I start using Angular for this project.
