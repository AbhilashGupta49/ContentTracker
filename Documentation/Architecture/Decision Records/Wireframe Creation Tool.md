## Summary

### Issue

I want to pick out a tool for creating wireframes for the project.

### Decision

Use **Figma** for creating project wireframes.

### Status

ADOPTED

## Details

### Assumptions

1. I might need the tool to be available for the duration of the project. So, limited time trials would not work for
   me.

### Constraints

1. The tool should work on Ubuntu system.
2. The tool should not require any special equipment (other than keyboard/mouse) to create wireframes.
3. The tool should be free to use for the duration of our usage.

### Positions

Since I am starting on a new project for which I would need to create UI screens, I need a tool to create wireframes for
the same. I have never used a wireframe tool before this.

I started by exploring 3 tools - **Figma**, **InVision** and **Draw.io**. In this **Figma** and **InVision** have free
tiers and **Draw.io** is an open source tool.

To use **Figma** on Ubuntu, I had to download and install the `figma-linux` snap. Also, to access the tool, I had to
create an account with Figma. It has lots of options built-in to quickly create basic wireframes. Also, there are many
how-to guides available on the internet.

To use **InVision**, I had to create an account with it. It gives you access to an online version of the tool. It is a
general purpose prototyping tool that requires use of additional tools for creating wireframes. It was not very
intuitive to use on my first attempt.

We don't need any account to use **Draw.io**. It has an online version which includes a very easy to use interface and
useful icons.

### Arguments

1. Not considering **InVision** because it was not very intuitive to use on my first attempt. Also, it feels like a
   subset
   of Figma from capabilities perspective.
2. Not considering **Draw.io**. Although it was the easiest to use and most intuitive tool out of all the tools I
   explored, it still felt like it had fewer options and was less powerful than the other tools.
3. Will be using **Figma** because it was intuitive and easy to use and the most powerful tool with many options. Also,
   since it is one of the most popular tool use for creating wireframes, I feel that it would be really useful to learn
   how to
   properly use it from gaining a personal skill perspective, and creating wireframes from the project's perspective.

### Implications

There would be a learning curve (although not very steep) for creating wireframes with **Figma** which may extend the
timelines of the project. From a personal standpoint, learning to use it would be really beneficial. Moreover, switching
to another tool would not be a huge effort, given the similarity of some popular wireframe tools.

## Notes

1. Figma can be installed as a snap using the command - `sudo snap install figma-linux`
